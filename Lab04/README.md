## Analysis of uocampus
### Demand
Uozone does not allow a user to make schedule modifications of a course which said user is already enrolled in. The course can be dropped and the user can re-apply but risks being put in a waiting list. Students would like to be able to change a course component which is available for mulitple time slots, like a lab session.
### Supply
An interative element (like a button) which clearly indicates to the user that the course's time is modifiable. Essentially, allowing the student to access the enroll page of the same course and only allowing the schedule to be updated if the time slot is available. This side steps the limbo phase, mentioned in the Demand.
