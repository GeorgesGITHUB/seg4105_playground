## Analysis of uocampus
### Demand
Uozone does not allow a user to make schedule modifications of a course which said user is already enrolled in. The course can be dropped and the user can re-apply but risks being put in a waiting list. Students would like to be able to change a course component which is available for mulitple time slots, like a lab session.
### Supply
An interative element (like a button) which clearly indicates to the user that the course's time is modifiable. Essentially, allowing the student to access the enroll page of the same course and only allowing the schedule to be updated if the time slot is available. This side steps the limbo phase, mentioned in the Demand.

## Analysis of project feature
### Demand
The project does not allow for a fast analysis of the data collected. Every feature, such as, the data filter and all the different maps/plots displaying the data are seperated by a navigation bar. This discourages the user from using the features by constantly reloading the webpage as the user switches from one map/plot to the other while manipulating the data filters
### Supply
Removing the navigation and instead having a user interface such that these features are widgets which modify the single page app seemlessly. This improves usability by allowing users to rapidly change which map/plot is being displayed while adjusting the filters.
